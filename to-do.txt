WAYGO DEVELOPMENT TO-DO LIST

[FRONTEND]

-   Landing home page / for both logged/non-logged in users
    background image, colour scheme and NYC/TORONTO videos in background

-   footer on the landing page (social media links/images, contacts, email, etc.)

    -   implement login/register form animation/jquery for smooth transition
        between the two (on one page, no redirect/refresh?)

    -   write doRegister() method to fetch backend /account/register route


    [refactoring]

    ✔ Move all components out of App.js into components, render them conditionally
      in App.js using in-html if-statements and UserStore state (isLoggedIn, etc.)
    
    ✔ Render App.js from index.js, use Router in App.js

    ✔   move map from App.js into MapComponent to be included from App.js.




[BACKEND]

-   configure backend /account/register route to respond with inserting
    user register data into user sql database and respond with success
